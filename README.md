# Machine Learning Engine (mle)

Golang Machine Learn Engine is a "for fun" project that aims at implementing several machine learning algorythms and a few applications for them as examples.

For now, it is at early development stage and is by no means ready for use anywhere. As soon as it is usefull, I will let you know!
